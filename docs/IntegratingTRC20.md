# Integrating Tron Token

Integration of Tron TRC20 Token is fairly straightforward and consist of following integration scheme.
Integration is done in 2 steps.

 1. Adjusting zelcore files
 2. Adjusting rates/markets repository

## Adjusting zelcore Files

Adjustment consist of editing 3 files AND adding logo
Zelcore repository is located at [zelcore Github](https://github.com/zelcore-io/zelcore)
Files that need to be adjusted are coinsSimple.js, coininfo.json,  and newssources.json

### coinSimple.js

This file consist of an object of coin objects. This is a definition of a coin and technically everything that is needed for a coin to function in zelcore. Coin specification is a named object. In case of Tron TRC20 Tokens, following configuration shall be present

```js
    suntrc: {
      coin: "suntrc",
      name: "sun",
      uri: [
        "sun",
      ],
      contractOrNumber: "TKkeiboTkxXKJpbmVFbv4a8ov5rAfRDMf9",
      decimals: 18,
      addresses: [],
      api: [
        "https://api.trongrid.io/",
      ],
      unit: "SUN",
      type: "tron",
      explorer: [
        "https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/",

      node: [
        "https://api.trongrid.io/",
      ],
      fee: 0.1,
      feepolicy: {
        economy: 3,
        normal: 50,
        fast: 100,
      },
      color: "#ffd609",
      backend: [
        "tron",
      ],
    },
```

### newssources.json

zelcore contains News section. A general one and asset news section as well. It can handle many of RSS feeds
Here is an example for Quant

    qnt: [
      {
        name: "SUN Twitter",
        feed: "https://nitter.zelcore.io/defi_sunio/rss",
        site: "https://twitter.com/defi_sunio",
        about: "SUN (SUN) is a cryptocurrency designed to further the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) on blockchain network TRON (TRX).",
        pic: "@/assets/logos/SUN.svg",
      },
    ],
This array is an object of available news for an asset.

- name - name of the news
- feed - rss feed for the news
- site - site for the news for browsing
- about - short description. Less than 300 characters!
- pic - logo displayed in case a news does not have a logo in the rss feed. Usually for assets we display the coin logo

### Logo

Please look at many examples in [Logos directory](https://github.com/zelcore-io/zelcore/blob/master/logos/). This is where your logo has to be placed. It has to be a nice SVG in correspondence with zelcore design of other logos. This logo will be used for your asset. Make it pretty and clean :)

## Rates & Markets

Zelcore uses its own Rates and Markets services. The repository can be found in [rates-api](https://github.com/zelcore-io/rates-api).
1 File have to be adjusted at rates-api/src/services/. Add the asset's aggregator ID on the corresponding list. Adding the ID of one aggregetor is enough.

 1. coinAggregatorIDs.js

You can find them in [services folder](https://github.com/zelcore-io/rates-api/blob/master/src/services/) of rates-api.
Adjustment is usually very simple and adding just your UNIT to an api call will do. Or you can write a custom call specifically for your asset. Note that the output of the asset has to be the UNIT used in zelcore coinSimple.js file.

## Notes

Please follow the styling, try using linting in your pull requests. We use 2 spaces, double quotes, commas.
