Integration is done in 2 steps.

 1. Adjusting zelcore files

Here is an example for Quant

      {
        name: "Tether Blog",
        feed: "https://tether.to/feed",
        site: "https://tether.to/press",
        about: "USDT is a cryptocurrency asset issued on the Ethereum blockchain via the ERC20 Token Standard. It is also issued on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Omni Layer Protocol.",
        pic: "@/assets/logos/USDT.svg",
      },
      {
        name: "Tether Twitter",
        feed: "https://nitter.zelcore.io/tether_to/rss",
        site: "https://twitter.com/tether_to",
        about: "USDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a Hong Kong-based company Tether.",
        pic: "@/assets/logos/USDT.svg",
      },
    ],

This array is an object of available news for an asset.

- name - name of the news
- feed - rss feed for the news
- site - site for the news for browsing
- about - short description. Less than 300 characters!
- pic - logo displayed in case a news does not have a logo in the rss feed. Usually for assets we display the coin logo

### Logo

Please look at many examples in [Logos directory](https://github.com/zelcore-io/zelcore/blob/master/logos/). This is where your logo has to be placed. It has to be a nice SVG in correspondence with zelcore design of other logos. This logo will be used for your asset. Make it pretty and clean :)

## Rates & Markets

Zelcore uses its own Rates and Markets services. The repository can be found in [rates-api](https://github.com/zelcore-io/rates-api).
1 File have to be adjusted at rates-api/src/services/. Add the asset's aggregator ID on the corresponding list. Adding the ID of one aggregetor is enough.

 1. coinAggregatorIDs.js

You can find the file in [services folder](https://github.com/zelcore-io/rates-api/blob/master/src/services/) of rates-api.

Please follow the styling, try using linting in your pull requests. We use 2 spaces, double quotes, commas.
