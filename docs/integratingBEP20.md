        site: "https://www.reddit.com/r/pancakeswap",
        about: "PancakeSwap is a Binance Smart Chain-based DEX launched by anonymous devs with a penchant for breakfast foods and rabbits.",
        pic: "@/assets/logos/CAKE.svg",

        name: "PancakeSwap Medium",
        feed: "https://medium.com/feed/@pancakeswap",
        site: "https://pancakeswap.medium.com",
        about: "PancakeSwap is a Binance Smart Chain-based DEX launched by anonymous devs with a penchant for breakfast foods and rabbits.",
        pic: "@/assets/logos/CAKE.svg",
      },
    ],
This array is an object of available news for an asset.

- name - name of the news
- feed - rss feed for the news
- site - site for the news for browsing
- about - short description. Less than 300 characters!
- pic - logo disaplyed in case a news does not have a logo in the rss feed. Usually for assets we display the coin logo

### Logo

Please look at many examples in [Logos directory](https://github.com/zelcore-io/zelcore/blob/master/logos/). This is where your logo has to be placed. It has to be a nice SVG in correspondence with zelcore design of other logos. This logo will be used for your asset. Make it pretty and clean :)

## Rates & Markets

Zelcore uses its own Rates and Markets services. The repository can be found in [rates-api](https://github.com/zelcore-io/rates-api).
1 File have to be adjusted at rates-api/src/services/. Add the asset's aggregator ID on the corresponding list. Adding the ID of one aggregetor is enough.

 1. coinAggregatorIDs.js

You can find them in [services folder](https://github.com/zelcore-io/rates-api/blob/master/src/services/) of rates-api.
Adjustment is usually very simple and adding just your UNIT to an api call will do. Or you can write a custom call specifically for your asset. Note that the output of the asset has to be the UNIT used in zelcore coinSimple.js file.

## Notes

Please follow the styling, try using linting in your pull requests. We use 2 spaces, double quotes, commas.
